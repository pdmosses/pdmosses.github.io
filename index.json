A secondary aim is to test whether the denotations of individual programs have expected properties.\nThe Problem #A Scott–Strachey style denotational semantics1 is based on Scott-domains. It assumes that a domain is an appropriate kind of cpo, and defines domains (up to isomorphism) using various domain constructors, allowing mutual recursion. All functions on domains specified in λ-notation are Scott-continuous, and endofunctions have least fixed points.\nAgda does not assume that types are Scott-domains, nor that functions specified in λ-notation are continuous. Some Agda libraries have been developed to support Scott-domains; but when using them, a domain is represented as a pair of a type of elements and other data; and a continuous function is represented as a pair of a function and a proof of its continuity. These representations give rise to undesirable notational overhead and obfuscation when specifying elements of domains in λ-notation.\nAs a novice Agda user, I developed a lightweight workaround for this problem, reported in Towards Verification of a Denotational Semantics of Inheritance (2024) and Lightweight Agda Formalization of Denotational Semantics (2025).\nHowever, it would clearly be better to develop a more principled solution, based on an implementation of Synthetic Domain Theory (SDT) in Agda. The assistance of expert Agda users will surely be needed\u0026hellip;\nA Proposed Approach #The idea is to allow named types to be declared to be domains (or predomains). To avoid extending the syntax of Agda, it has been suggested to me that a universe Domain (hierarchy) could be added as built-in, although that would require extending the Agda compiler.\nWhen declared to be a domain, an Agda type is to have a partial order with a least element ⊥, closed (at least) under limits of monotone ascending ω-chains. All functions between domains are to be Scott-continuous, preserving the partial order and limits; the limit of the ascending Kleene chain of an endofunction on a domain is then its least fixed point.\nGroups of Agda types declared to be domains are to be definable (up to isomorphism) in terms of flat domains (lifted sets) and built-in domain constructors (including function domains, Cartesian products, sum domains, lifted domains). The type of all functions from an ordinary type to a domain may also be treated as a domain, implicitly ordered pointwise.\nRecursive references to domains are not to require guards, and type checking is to allow the isomorphisms between domains and their definitions to be left implicit when expressing elements of domains in λ-notation.\nExperiments #Some experiments with using a simplified version2 of the above approach are listed in web pages and PDFs at https://pdmosses.github.io/xds-agda/. The experiments currently include denotational semantics of the untyped λ-calculus, PCF, and Scm (a simple sublanguage of Scheme).\nComments and suggestions for improvement are welcome! A denotational semantics of a programming language maps programs and their phrases directly to their denotations: immutable values \u0026ndash; typically higher-order functions. The denotation of a complete program represents its potential behaviour when executed. Denotations are compositional: the denotation of a phrase is defined inductively in terms of the denotations of its subphrases, independently of their form. The denotations of loops and recursive definitions involve fixed points of functions on denotations.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFor simplicity, domains are defined to be unordered pointed sets, and endofunctions are required only to have well-defined fixed points. Postulates corresponding to the intended cpo structure of domains, and the continuity of functions between domains, are to be added.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":null,"permalink":"/software/ds-in-agda/","section":"Software Projects","summary":"","title":"Denotational Semantics in Agda"},{"content":"Professor Emeritus (Computer Science, Swansea University)\nVisitor (Programming Languages Group, Computer Science, TU Delft)\nCareer overview Education and Affiliations #I studied maths and computer science at Oxford, and completed my doctorate in 1975.

Computations require labels on adjacent transitions to be composable.\nSee the MSOS in Prolog project for how to run programs using MSOS rules specified in Prolog. The Prolog MSOS Tool was used in undergraduate courses on formal semantics at Aarhus (2001–2004).\nFrom the first publication about MSOS:\nModular SOS is a form of SOS that ensures a high degree of modularity: the transition rules for each construct are completely independent of the presence or absence of other constructs in the described language. When one extends or changes the described language, the description can be extended or changed accordingly, without reformulation – even though new kinds of information processing may be required.\nThis is in marked contrast to conventional SOS, where modularity tends to be quite poor: when extending a pure functional language with concurrency primitives and/or references, for instance, the original specification of the transition rules has to be completely reformulated.\nIn denotational semantics, the problem of obtaining good modularity has received much attention, and has to a large extent been solved by introducing so-called monad transformers. Modular SOS provides an analogous solution for operational semantics.\nThe basic idea of Modular SOS is to incorporate all semantic entities as components of labels. Thus configurations are restricted to syntax and computed values. The foundations of Modular SOS involve a novel form of labelled transition system (LTS), where the labels are the arrows of a category.\nIn contrast to other frameworks where labels are equipped with categorical structure (e.g. Tile Logic and Rewriting Logic), composition here is generally a partial operation, and computations are restricted to those where all adjacent labels are composable. Note that the labels are no longer the simple atomic actions often used in studies of process algebra, but here usually have entities such as environments and stores as components; so do the objects of the label category, which correspond to the states of the processed information.\nThree fundamental label transformers have been identified; they preserve the computations specified by a modular SOS, and their order of application is irrelevant. The label transformers are analogous to some simple monad transformers.\nThe one which transforms the label category to incorporate new context information (such as the current environment) adds the same sort of component both to arrows and to objects, and composition preserves the value of that component. Also the transformer which incorporates mutable information (such as the current store) adds a corresponding component to each object, whereas it extends each arrow with a pair of such components; composition on pairs is as for binary relations. Finally, the transformer which incorporates emitted information (such as synchronization signals) adds a corresponding component to each arrow, but leaves the objects essentially unchanged. \u0026mdash; Foundations of Modular SOS (preprint)\nMSOS allows the semantics of individual programming constructs to be specified independently, which is of crucial importance for the PLanCompS project.\nI-MSOS #I-MSOS (Implicitly-Modular SOS) allows the use of conventional SOS notation in MSOS: specifications use explicit labels only for emitted information, and the label components for any contextual and mutable information are left implicit.\nIn contrast to a transition system specification in process algebra, a structural operational semantics (SOS) of a programming language usually involves auxiliary entities: stores, environments, etc. When specifying SOS rules, particular auxiliary entities often need to be propagated unchanged between premises and conclusions. The standard technique is to make such propagation explicit, using variables. However, referring to all entities that need to be propagated unchanged in each rule can be tedious, and it hinders direct reuse of rules in different language descriptions.\nThis paper proposes a new interpretation of SOS rules, such that each auxiliary entity is implicitly propagated in all rules in which it is not mentioned. The main benefits include significant notational simplification of SOS rules and much-improved reusability. \u0026gt; This new interpretation of SOS rules is based on the same foundations as Modular SOS, but avoids the notational overhead of grouping auxiliary entities together in labels.\nAfter motivating and explaining implicit propagation, the paper considers the foundations of SOS and Modular SOS specifications, and defines the meaning of SOS specifications with implicit propagation by translating them to Modular SOS. It then shows how implicit propagation can simplify various rules found in the SOS literature.\n\u0026mdash; Implicit Propagation in Structural Operational Semantics\nThe CBS meta-notation for component-based semantics incorporates an combination of I-MSOS and term rewriting.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/research/msos/","section":"Research Projects","summary":"","title":"MSOS"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/sos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SOS"},{"content":"The ASD Tools (1992–1996) supported the original version of action semantics.\nThey were based on the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment, and developed with Arie van Deursen (then at CWI, Amsterdam).\n","date":null,"permalink":"/software/asd-tools/","section":"Software Projects","summary":"","title":"ASD Tools"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/algebraic-specification/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Algebraic Specification"},{"content":"CoFI (Common Framework Initiative, 1995–2005) was a collaborative project to develop a common framework for algebraic specification and development of software.\nOne of the main outcomes of CoFI is CASL (Common Algebraic Specification Language).

It was used as the meta-notation for specifying action semantics.\nA unified algebra is a kind of total homogeneous algebra, i.e., a set equipped with some total functions. Particular unified algebras represent data types; classes of unified algebras represent abstract data types. This paper establishes an institution, i.e., a logical specification framework, for specifying abstract data types as classes of unified algebras.\nThe carrier of a unified algebra is a distributive lattice with a bottom. The functions of the algebra always include the join and meet of the lattice, and a constant denoting the bottom of the lattice. All functions are required to be monotone with respect to the partial order of the lattice.\nThe main idea is that the values in the carrier of a unified algebra represent not only elements of data, but also classifications of elements into sorts. For instance, a unified algebra representing a data type of numbers and lists would have values not only for particular numbers and particular lists, but also for the sort of all numbers and the sort of all lists.\nThe lattice partial order of the carrier represents sort inclusion; the join and meet operations represent sort union and intersection. The bottom of the lattice represents the empty sort. The empty sort, shunned in conventional algebraic frameworks, provides a particularly natural way of representing the lack of result of partial operations – avoiding the need to introduce special \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; elements.

However, that turned out to be over-ambitious, and the main application of SIS was as tool support for teaching denotational semantics (personally at Aarhus, and by colleagues at universities in some other countries).\nMoreover, attempts to develop denotational semantics for larger programming languages in SIS clearly exposed a significant lack of modularity in the meta-notation.
