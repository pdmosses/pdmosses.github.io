PLanCompS (Programming Language Components and Specifications, since 2011) is an open international collaboration, continuing from an
[EPSRC-funded research project (2011-16)].

The main activity of PLanCompS is the development of the [CBS] framework,
meta-language, and tool support, together with examples of language specification using CBS.

See the [PLanCompS] home page.
