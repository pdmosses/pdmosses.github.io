[CoFI] (Common Framework Initiative, 1995â€“2005) was a collaborative project to develop a common framework for algebraic specification and development of software.

One of the main outcomes of CoFI is [CASL] (Common Algebraic Specification Language).
CASL, together with its sub-languages and extensions,
provides succinct notation for the various concepts and constructs of previous algebraic specification languages. Its main features are as follows:

> - CASL is based on a critical selection of known constructs.
> - It is an expressive, simple, pragmatic language.
> - It is suitable for specifying requirements and design for conventional software packages
> - It has restrictions to various sublanguages.
> - It has extensions to higher-order, state-based, concurrent, and other languages.
> - Use of CASL is supported by tools.

[IFIP WG 1.3] supported CoFI, and members of WG 1.3 reviewed the design and definition of CASL.

The [CASL Reference Manual] and a [CASL User Manual] are published by Springer,
and available in PDF from the [CoFI] website ([CASL-RM], [CASL-UM]).

[Hets] (the heterogeneous tool set) supports use of CASL and its extensions
in various automated and interactive theorem provers.
