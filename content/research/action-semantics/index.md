Action Semantics (1985â€“2005) is a hybrid of denotational and operational semantics,
developed in collaboration with [David Watt] (Glasgow).

An action semantics of a programming language maps syntax compositionally to action notation,
and the semantics of action notation is defined using SOS (structural operational semantics).

See the [Wikipedia] page and the [Action Semantics book].

The non-modularity of the original SOS of action notation prompted the development of
[MSOS] (a modular variant of SOS using labeled transitions)
and [I-MSOS] (a version of MSOS using conventional SOS notation).
