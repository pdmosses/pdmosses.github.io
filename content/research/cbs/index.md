*CBS* (Component-Based Semantics, since 2004) is a framework and meta-language for *component-based specification of programming languages*. 
The main idea is to translate languages to so-called *'funcons'* ([fundamental programming constructs][Funcons-beta]).
The behaviour of the funcons has already been specified,
so translating a language to funcons determines the behaviour of all programs in that language.

CBS was developed by the [PLanCompS] research project.
From 2011 to 2016, the project was funded by EPSRC in the UK.
PLanCompS is now an open international collaboration.

The [CBS-beta] website documents the current proposal for CBS.
