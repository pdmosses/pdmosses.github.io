### Education and Affiliations

I studied maths and computer science at Oxford, and completed my doctorate in 1975. After a postdoc at Oxford, I moved to Denmark, to a lectureship at [Aarhus][Aarhus University]. I moved back to the UK in 2005, to a chair at [Swansea][Swansea University]. I retired and became [emeritus][Professor Emeritus] in 2016, then moved to The Netherlands, where I am currently visiting [TU Delft].

### Semantics

My research in semantics of programming languages stretches back to [Christopher Strachey]’s [Programming Research Group] at Oxford University in the early 1970s. During my graduate studies under Strachey's supervision, I contributed to the development of [denotational semantics], and implemented [SIS], a system for generating programming language interpreters from denotational semantics.

### Modularity

The main focus of my research since the 1980s has been on pragmatic aspects of semantic specifications – especially modularity. This led to the development of [action semantics], [MSOS] (a modular variant of structural operational semantics) and [CBS] (component-based semantics). I was a principal investigator in the EPSRC-funded [PLanCompS] project (Programming Language Components and Specifications), which developed CBS.

### Algebraic specification

In the 1980s and 1990s, I also participated in research on [algebraic specification] of data types and software. I was the initial coordinator of [CoFI], the Common Framework Initiative, which designed the algebraic specification language [CASL]; and I was a chair of [IFIP Working Group 1.3] (on Foundations of System Specification).
