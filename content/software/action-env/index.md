The Action Environment (2001-2005) was a prototype tool that supported use of
so-called *constructive* action semantics
(a hybrid of action semantics and component-based semantics).

It was based on The Meta-Environment, and developed with
Mark van den Brand (then at CWI, Amsterdam) and
Jørgen Iversen (then at Aarhus).

It was never released – partly because action semantics was superseded by CBS,
partly due to the work needed to update the implementation to a new release
of The Meta-Environment.
