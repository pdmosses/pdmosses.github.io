The [MSOS in Prolog] project (2002â€“2004) illustrates how [MSOS] rules
for the dynamic semantics of a simple imperative programming language
can be written as Prolog clauses.
The language and the rules are from a paper about MSOS (2004).
The Prolog clauses correspond closely to the MSOS rules specified in the paper.

Running programs using the Prolog clauses tests whether the MSOS rules specify
the expected behaviour.
