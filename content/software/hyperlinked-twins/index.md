[Hyperlinked twins] of code repositories (developed since 2023) are websites that support precise name-based code navigation using ordinary web browsers.
The hyperlinks and highlighting make it much easier to browse, explore, and understand code
in unfamiliar repositories or languages.

A paper about generation of hyperlinked twins was [presented at SLE] in October 2023:

> [Online Name-Based Navigation for Software Meta-languages]

The sources of hyperlinked twin websites are generated by [Spoofax] from raw code on GitHub.
The aim is for a future release of Spoofax to support generation of hyperlinked twins
for code in all [Spoofax meta-languages].
