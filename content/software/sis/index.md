SIS (semantics implementation system, 1972â€“1979) used partial evaluation
to run programs according to their denotational semantics.

It included an SLR(1) parser generator,
a call-by-need lambda-notation interpreter,
and a translator from denotational semantics specifications to lambda-expressions.

SIS was written in BCPL at Oxford (1972--1976) and Aarhus (1976--1979),
and ported to several operating systems.

My [dissertation] (1975) describes an early version of SIS.
The SIS [Reference Manual] and [Tested Examples] document the final version.
