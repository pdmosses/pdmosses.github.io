Just the Docs (contributor since 2016, maintainer since 2020) is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll].
Source files for web pages can use [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.

I have used Just the Docs for the [CBS-beta] and [CBS IDE] websites.

See the [Just the Docs] website.
