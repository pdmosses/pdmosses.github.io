The focus of my current research is further development of the component-based approach to semantics of programming languages, established by the **[PLanCompS](http://www.plancomps.org/)** project, together with tool support and major case studies.

- **[Beta-release of CBS](https://plancomps.github.io/CBS-beta/)** – a framework for component-based specification of programming languages

  - [*Funcons-beta*](https://plancomps.github.io/CBS-beta/Funcons-beta/): an initial library of 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs)
  - [*Languages-beta*](https://plancomps.github.io/CBS-beta/Languages-beta/): several illustrative languages specified by translation to funcons

- **[Modularity'16](http://2016.modularity.info/)** **Demonstration Track paper**: *Tool support for component-based semantics*, with [Thomas van Binsbergen](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/thomas-van-binsbergen(bf15f269-6564-44e7-a089-3495c671caf6).html) and [Neil Sculthorpe](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/ucac009/)

- **SIS – Semantics Implementation System** (1979): *Reference Manual* (PDF), *Tested Examples* (PDF), copied from the **[Semantics Library](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/semantics-library/)** of [Cliff B Jones](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/)

- **My festschrift:** [*Semantics and Algebraic Specification*](http://www.springer.com/computer/foundations/book/978-3-642-04163-1), edited by [Jens Palsberg](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/), with contributions by many international colleagues and former students, published by Springer as  [LNCS 5700](http://www.springer.com/computer/foundations/book/978-3-642-04163-1):
